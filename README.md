# Healthcare-Management-Project
The purpose of the project “Healthcare Management System” is to computerize the Front Office Management of Hospital by developing a software to keep a track of patients,
blood bank and record them which is simple, fast, cost-effective and user-friendly.

The valid username and password lead to the Home Page of the software which provides different buttons having various functionalities. A search facility is embedded to look for a patient’s information using their unique ID. A history of all patients is also available through this page. A blood bank embedded within that records various details of donors and keeping a track of quantity of blood available.
Hence, this project navigates us through the hospital patients details and blood bank in a convenient and efficient manner.
